# Nut Graphics Engine

## Description

The Nut Engine is a lightweight and modular graphics engine designed to facilitate the development of 3D applications using OpenGL. It abstracts the complexity of OpenGL setup and rendering, providing a simple interface for loading models, shaders, and rendering scenes. The engine is built with C++ and utilizes GLFW for window management and GLM for mathematics.

## Features

- **Model Loading**: Supports loading and rendering 3D models.
- **Shader Management**: Allows for easy integration and management of vertex and fragment shaders.
- **Camera Control**: Implements basic camera movements and view transformations.
- **OpenGL Integration**: Simplifies OpenGL initialization and rendering processes.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add new features and extend functionality.

## Requirements

- C++17
- CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
- GLFW (included in external folder)
- GLAD (included in external folder)
- OpenGL 

## Building the Project

To build the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** or download the project files.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a build directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
4. Run CMake to configure the project:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```
5. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
6. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./output
   ```

## Usage

To use the engine, create an instance of the `Engine` class and call the `render` method with the path to the model you want to load. For example:

```cpp
Engine engine;
engine.render("path/to/your/model.obj");
```
